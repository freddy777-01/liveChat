# liveChat
## Simple Live Chat Simulation built with Ajax#Jquery and PHP #web-based
> The Most part that we had focused on is implementiation of `Object-Orientend-Programming` with `PHP`

Here what it does:
1. user registration
2. user can login
3. users can chat(sending each other messages)
4. user can create group
5. user can delete the group
6. user can subscribe to a group
7. group chat
8. sending file in a group chat `upcomingðŸ§­`
9. user can upload picture
10. users can send files to each other `upcomingðŸ§­`

âš  It might have less security, take notice before implementing it.
